                Using the internet to browse our favorite websites or apps on our phones is something everyone does every single day. It's almost impossible to avoid it and because of that, we don't really think about what those apps and websites are doing while we use them. That's right, websites you use every day have to keep track of you and what you do. They do this by using cookies, a tool that collects and stores information about you. This can be both a good and bad thing. The good thing about cookies is that when you log into your Facebook account, you stay logged in the entire time you use the site instead of having to log in every time you click on a link. But the bad side of cookies is that sometimes websites keep holding onto these cookies and take the data they've collected about you to use for something else entirely. Companies do this so they can get information on you and things you like so that later on they can show you ads that they think you'll be interested in. And since they used your data to make these ads appear to you, they purposefully try to target you with these ads so you spend money on a product. Cookies are a powerful tool that even allow companies to make assumptions about your interests and even who you may be as a person. It's important to understand that when using websites or apps they might be collecting some kind of data about you and if you aren't comfortable giving them this information, then stop using their site. Otherwise, try and make sure to clear your browsing history and cookies after leaving a website. Companies are always trying to track anyone who uses their websites, but you can do your best to try and prevent them from learning too much about you.
