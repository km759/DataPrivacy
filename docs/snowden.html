                On September 11th 2001, a tragic event occurred. Many lives were taken and life as we know it in the american grounds changed forever. When the twin towers fell, America was at great fear and they could not feel safe around their neighborhood knowing that if it happened to a monumental building, why it couldn't happen to them also at any time? This is when the NSA came into play. They did whatever they could to protect the citizens of the United States of America by making things much safer than before. But how much safe is too safe? The citizens of the United States of America were living their lives a bit better knowing that they were being protected by their own government, some people knew that they collected some data in order for them to track potential terrorism. But, in reality we did not really know how much data they collected. This is where Edward Snowden comes into play. This individual used to work for the NSA and he was able to reveal to the world how much information the United States of America was taking from its citizens. It was so much information that it was taking away our freedom. Edward Snowden risked his life in order for the American citizens to understand what the government was really doing under their noses, and without anyone realizing how much was taking from them it took a big turn when Edward Snowden revealed all of this. The government used the operation called PRISM, in this operation every internet provider would have to give all of the private data collected from each customer without their consent. Google, Yahoo, Youtube and others also had to hand in all of the data that they had collected of each individual in order for the NSA to keep their citizens "safe". After everything was revealed, a lot has changed. But deep in our minds we know that the government is still spying on us illegally one way or the other. Thanks to Edward Snowden, at least more American citizens were able to open their eyes to the truth that the government is capable of breaking their own rules and moral if they think it'll benefit the country one way ot the other.
