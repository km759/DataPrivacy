            </div>
            </br>

            <p>
                In this section, we'll be learning how to become completely anonymous. We'll go from easy steps to more complex steps depending on how anonymous you'll want to be. We'll categorize them by zones, zone 1 being the easiest steps to follow while zone 4 is going to be the hardcore steps to become anonymous completely.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>Zone 1</h1>
            <p>In this zone we can do the following steps in order for us to become anonymous. These are simple steps to follow and it will help you or someone that you know stay more secure and anonymous in the internet.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Password Manager:</b> You could easily set up a manager password in order for you to keep all of your passwords secure in one place. You can get the application for Windows or Android, you can sync all of your accounts passwords in here to make it more secure. </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Strong Password for Password Manager:</b> If you want to be secure at all cost you'll have to make sure that your Password Manager has a difficult password to get. Having your name or simple numbers in there will definitely never do the trick. Try to make it as complex as possible so that no one can access your passwords.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>2 Factor Authentication:</b> This method is extremely effective when it comes to keeping your accounts secure. The user will need a special code sent to the authenticator in order for them to have access to your account. This can also work with your mobile phone number.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Only Trusted Web Extensions:</b> Having a extension like honey can help you save lots of money whenever you buy online. So, why not take advantage of this and use extensions for our security? We could use some extensions to hide our identities.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>DuckDuckGo or Startpage Search:</b> Using the Google search bar might sound useful and easy to use. Sadly, they collect so much information out of you that becoming anonymous is almost impossible with them on your side. Lucky, search engines like DuckDuckGo and Startpage are great search engines that can keep you anonymous while you go on about your business.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Paid VPN Service:</b> I sucks reading the words "Paid" and "VPN" combined, but, when it comes to your anonymity it is essential that you have the best protection out there. Free VPNs are not the most reliable source to hide your tracks while you are on the web.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>No Real Social Media Information:</b> If you want to stay anonymous, make sure not to include your real name, address or phone number on your social media. This also includes photos, public comments or talking to strangers. Only talk to family members and friends.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Disable Social Media Permissions:</b> Make sure you don't grant your social medias any access of any kind, including location, sharing reports or anything that puts your information at risk.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Secret Google Number Or iNumbr:</b> In order for you to stay as anonymous as possible, you'll have to use fake phone numbers so that no one can track you back. Secret Google Number or iNumbr can help you create a fake number to fill out some forms in case you are asked to put your phone number.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Disable Phone Usage Data:</b> If you are not using your phone at the moment, disable your phone usage data at all time.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Activate VPN on Phone:</b> VPN is not only used for computers and laptops, phones also benefits from this powerful tool that hides your identity.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Phone Location Mostly Off:</b> As simple as it sounds, you want your phone location to be off unless if absolutely necessary to have it on.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Phone Bluetooth Mostly Off:</b> Same with your bluetooth, you don't want to have it on unless is necessary/</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Remove Unused Apps:</b> Having apps not being in used can cause a lot of problems. They can be stealing your information without you even knowing.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Disable PC Usage Data:</b> Removing the usage of your pc data can also keep you anonymous while you browse the web.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Active VPN on PC:</b> As soon as you turn on your PC, make sure you have your VPN turned on through the duration of your session.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>PC Location Mostly Off:</b> Like in the previous point turning off your phone location, your pc should also have the location setting off.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>PC Bluetooth Mostly Off:</b> If your pc has bluetooth by any chance, make sure that it is turned off all the time unless is needed at the moment.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Remove Unused Programs:</b> Removed unused programs from your pc will help you stay more secure and is less likely that someone can take your information through an unused app if is not present.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Congratulations! You just completed Zone 1! This is the basic steps to stay safe and secure yourself from malicious people out there.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Zone 2</h1>
            <br>
            <p>In this zone, things get a little more complex but, it'll help you stay more anonymous than zone 1.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>iMessage or Signal:</b> If you are still using a phone at this point, make sure you use iMessage since is a great way to encrypt your messages or Signal if you are using android.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Protonmail or Own Server:</b> Most email providers are always at risk of getting hacked, with Protonmail, you'll be at ease knowing that your emails and your information will be secure.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>iPhone or Stock Android Phone:</b> While many people hate iPhones or buying newer phones, sadly this will be the safest way for a person to stay the most secure out of anyone out there. These phone will often get updated with the latest security features that will keep the individual safer from malicious people out there in the world.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Wipe Storage Free Space Often:</b> Make sure to clean your storage often in order for you to leave no trace of whatever you had in your disks or memory.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Encrypt SSD:</b> If you have an SSD, make sure you encrypt it to have it be more secure.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Encrypt Android Devices:</b> If you don't know how to encrypt your android device, please go out there on youtube and lookup tutorials on your specific phone, there are tons of materials out there to choose from.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Only Use Traditional Password:</b> Make sure to avoid using voice passwords, pins, etc. Don't be lazy and type your complex password manually if you would like to be always secure!</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Change Default Router Password:</b> You'll be surprised at how many people still keep the same password whenever they get a new router.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Hide Router SSID:</b> Hiding your router SSID will prevent people from finding your network and it can potentially prevent someone from hacking into your wifi.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Disable Some Extensions:</b> Disabling some extensions like Flash and Javascript can help you prevent your browser from taking information out of you.</p>
            <br>
            <p>That's it for zone 2! This is a little more complicated than zone 1 but it'll keep you definitely safer than your average security measurements.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Zone 3</h1>
            <p>Now we are approaching a zone that will take more skills and more drastic measures in order for the individual cover up their tracts from the internet.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Switch to Linux:</b> Switching from your Windows OS can actually help you a lot. Windows tracks a lot of your information on a daily basis if you don't disable those features manually and Linux is the most secure OS out there next to apple.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Password On BIOS:</b> Whenever you boot up your PC there should a password to even access your loading screen. This can help individuals stay safer than your average Joe.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Delete Google Data:</b> Google always keep your information on their servers, you can manually remove some information to keep your anonymity more extended.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Ditch Social Media!:</b> Is a no brainier that having social media is the equivalent of giving consent to anyone to take your information and do whatever they please with it. Deleting all social medias from your life will in fact help you stay away from any dangerous of people stealing information from you.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Flip Phones Or Custom ROM:</b> Having a smart phone can be a blessing or a curse, but mostly a curse for most people who don't know how to hide their information. Having a flip phone can help you stay anonymous since all you need to do is make phone calls mostly, if you don't want that you can also get a custom ROM for your Android to stay hiding from everyone.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Use TOR Browser on your PC and Mobile:</b> Just like the title says, using TOR will help the individual browse the web with as much anonymity as possible since this browser deletes everything from your search history, cookies, proxy, etc.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Spend Money with Prepaid Cards or Cryptocurrencies:</b> As crazy as it sounds, it is much safer to pay using prepaid cards online or buying cryptocurrencies instead of you using your debit or credit card in a website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Congratulations! You completed Zone 3, a pretty difficult step towards becoming anonymous.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Zone 4</h1>
            <p>In this zone, we'll learn what do you have to do in order for you to become the most anonymous person out there if you followed all of the steps from zone 1 through 3. Now onto the last step of our journey.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>No Phone or Flip Phone:</b> No more texting, no more social media, no more calls. This is the final step for you to become anonymous and for no one to be able to track you down no matter what. If you can't let go of your precious phone, you can still use custom ROMs.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Spoof MAC Address:</b> As extreme as that sounds, each MAC address of each device in the world is unique. So having your MAC address being fake will definitely help you stay anonymous out there in the virtual world.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Prevent Social Engineering:</b> What does this mean? How can we prevent this? Well, in order for you to prevent social engineering you'll have to change the way that you type and communicate with people in order for you to never be recognized. </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Erasing Your Identity:</b> In this last step, you'll have to erase everything that you know about yourself online and make sure is deleted. There are ton of tutorials on how to delete your identity in the internet so I recommend finding one and get rolling!</p>
            <br>
            <p>And that's it! If you followed through all 4 zones and made sure everything is deleted, you'll be a ghost from now on lurking in the shadows and I am proud.</p>
